## 📌 Overview

This project is a **SQL-based job market analysis** developed using Microsoft SQL Server.  
It simulates a real-world scenario where job data is stored, managed, and analyzed using pure SQL.  
The dataset includes job listings, companies, job types, locations, experience levels, and required skills — all crafted to reflect the Egyptian job market.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The entire database and dataset were built from scratch manually.  
> No external datasets were used — all job listings, skills, and associated data were **custom-designed as fictional but realistic data** to mimic a real job market environment.

The project focuses on **database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying** to extract valuable insights from job trends, skill demand, and salary patterns across Egypt.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a structured relational database from scratch using DDL.
- Insert realistic and diverse job market data using DML.
- Use SQL queries to uncover job trends, salary categories, and skill demand.
- Categorize salaries using `CASE` statements.
- Practice SQL interview-style questions and real-world scenarios.
- Strengthen SQL Server skills with hands-on implementation.
