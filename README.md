## üìå Overview

This project is a **SQL-based job market analysis** developed using Microsoft SQL Server.  
It simulates a real-world scenario where job data is stored, managed, and analyzed using pure SQL.  
The dataset includes job listings, companies, job types, locations, experience levels, and required skills ‚Äî all crafted to reflect the Egyptian job market.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The entire database and dataset were built from scratch manually.  
> No external datasets were used ‚Äî all job listings, skills, and associated data were **custom-designed as fictional but realistic data** to mimic a real job market environment.

The project focuses on **database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying** to extract valuable insights from job trends, skill demand, and salary patterns across Egypt.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Build a structured relational database from scratch using DDL.
- Insert realistic and diverse job market data using DML.
- Use SQL queries to uncover job trends, salary categories, and skill demand.
- Categorize salaries using `CASE` statements.
- Practice SQL interview-style questions and real-world scenarios.
- Strengthen SQL Server skills with hands-on implementation.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- **Realistic Job Data:** Includes job titles, companies, locations, types, salaries, categories, experience levels, and required skills.
- **Multi-Table Structure:** Uses normalized tables with foreign keys to simulate a real job board database.
- **Insightful SQL Queries:**  
  - Identify the most in-demand skills  
  - Compare average salaries by city or category  
  - Detect top hiring companies  
  - Filter jobs based on job type, experience, or keywords  
  - Count job postings over time  
  - Rank jobs using `RANK()` and categorize salaries using `CASE`

## üß© Query Types Used

This project includes a wide variety of SQL query types, covering most of the critical features a Data Analyst or SQL Developer should master:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):**
  - `CREATE`, `ALTER` for managing schema structure.
  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
  - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  for working with table data.
  
- **Aggregate Functions:**
  - `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()` for summarizing data.

- **Window Functions:**
  - `RANK()` for ranking salaries by experience levels.

- **Joins (INNER JOIN):**
  - To relate jobs with companies, locations, and skills.

- **Subqueries:**
  - Used for filtering jobs dynamically (e.g., by skill count or salary thresholds).

- **Filtering & Pattern Matching:**
  - `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `HAVING` to answer specific business questions.

- **Grouping & Ordering:**
  - `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` for structured result analysis.

- **Date Functions:**
  - `FORMAT()`, `GETDATE()` to examine posting trends by month.

- **Conditional Logic:**
  - `CASE` statements to categorize salary levels (Low, Medium, High).
