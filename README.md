## 📌 Overview

This project is a **SQL-based job market analysis** developed using Microsoft SQL Server.  
It simulates a real-world scenario where job data is stored, managed, and analyzed using pure SQL.  
The dataset includes job listings, companies, job types, locations, experience levels, and required skills — all crafted to reflect the Egyptian job market.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The entire database and dataset were built from scratch manually.  
> No external datasets were used — all job listings, skills, and associated data were **custom-designed as fictional but realistic data** to mimic a real job market environment.

The project focuses on **database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying** to extract valuable insights from job trends, skill demand, and salary patterns across Egypt.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a structured relational database from scratch using DDL.
- Insert realistic and diverse job market data using DML.
- Use SQL queries to uncover job trends, salary categories, and skill demand.
- Categorize salaries using `CASE` statements.
- Practice SQL interview-style questions and real-world scenarios.
- Strengthen SQL Server skills with hands-on implementation.

## ✅ Key Features

- **Realistic Job Data:** Includes job titles, companies, locations, types, salaries, categories, experience levels, and required skills.
- **Multi-Table Structure:** Uses normalized tables with foreign keys to simulate a real job board database.
- **Insightful SQL Queries:**  
  - Identify the most in-demand skills  
  - Compare average salaries by city or category  
  - Detect top hiring companies  
  - Filter jobs based on job type, experience, or keywords  
  - Count job postings over time  
  - Rank jobs using `RANK()` and categorize salaries using `CASE`

## 🧩 Query Types Used

This project includes a wide variety of SQL query types, covering most of the critical features a Data Analyst or SQL Developer should master:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):**
  - `CREATE`, `ALTER` for managing schema structure.
  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
  - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  for working with table data.
  
- **Aggregate Functions:**
  - `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()` for summarizing data.

- **Window Functions:**
  - `RANK()` for ranking salaries by experience levels.

- **Joins (INNER JOIN):**
  - To relate jobs with companies, locations, and skills.

- **Subqueries:**
  - Used for filtering jobs dynamically (e.g., by skill count or salary thresholds).

- **Filtering & Pattern Matching:**
  - `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `HAVING` to answer specific business questions.

- **Grouping & Ordering:**
  - `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` for structured result analysis.

- **Date Functions:**
  - `FORMAT()`, `GETDATE()` to examine posting trends by month.

- **Conditional Logic:**
  - `CASE` statements to categorize salary levels (Low, Medium, High).
